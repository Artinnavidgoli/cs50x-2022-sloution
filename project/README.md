**INTRODOUCTION**

While many people enjoy using their smartphones, others find limited use for them. Some people find it awkward to text on a phone, and others can't handle the amount of distractions that phones provide.

NFC technology is a set of wireless standards for communication between electronic devices. It's based on the concept of contactless smart cards and personal identification tokens. These technologies use radio waves to transfer data between electronic devices. Some electronic devices are also built with NFC technology. These include credit cards, smart cards, payment cards, ticketing systems and more. In many ways, NFC technology is the future- it's exciting to think about what it will enable people to do in the future.

NFC technology is quickly becoming the defacto standard for communication between electronic devices. It's easy to access, transfer data and make phone calls. NFC technology is also easy to access in automobiles- it allows car owners to easily start their cars without using a key. The average person uses NFC technology daily without even thinking about it. The wide range of uses for this technology makes it a great thing for everyone to have access to.

NFC technology has many different applications in our daily lives. It allows us to quickly transfer data such as text, images and files between electronic devices. Many people also use NFC technology for ticketing and mass transportation purposes. Furthermore, doctors and healthcare professionals use NFC technology for patient identification purposes and logging medical records. In addition, emergency responders use NFC tags for quickly identifying victims during dangerous situations. These are just a few of the many uses for this technology that we're only just beginning to uncover.

Some worry about RF exposure and health issues caused by NFC technology. In particular, people have concerns about how electromagnetic waves affect our bodies. These waves can heat up your body and cause damage when they're too powerful- especially if they're frequencies you weren't expecting. Fortunately, most modern devices are built with safety in mind when using NFC technology. This includes keeping the frequency low to limit damage to your phone's battery and components as well as your body. Additionally, most modern phones have built-in shielding that protects you from dangerous electromagnetic waves while using NFC tags on your phone.

Overall, NFC technology has immense potential that we're just now starting to understand and use properly. We have a long way to go before this technology reaches its full potential, but it's exciting to think about where it could take us in the future. It's important not to forget about how far we've come with NFC technology since its inception- but also to be aware of how much further we still have to go before we reach our full potential with this tech!

**App Idea**

the main idea is make to make a new payment system like Paypal or AMEX based on nfc chip. but this app only can read nfc cards (because I'm a 14 year old this idea is too far :/ )

**WHY EVERYONE NEED TO USE NFC**
- time
- tax (the tax fee is for iran)
- corona pandamic (points from 1 up to 5)
 1. cash => 30 sec up to 3 min || no tax fee (almost) || point 1

 2. simple card => 1 up to 2 min || tax fee 3% (can be up to 5%) || point 3 (better than cash but you use the butten on the pos , too)

 3. online payment => 2 up to 10 min (because of 10 min limit) || tax fee 9% || point 5

4. nfc card or app => 30 sec up to 1 min || tax fee 3% || point 5

>best of time => nfc

>least tax fee => cash

>best for pandamic => nfc
